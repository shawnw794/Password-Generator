# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

For this project I modified a starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

At times employees have access to sensitive data that requires restricted access areas with pins and secure passcodes. I want to create a program that can ramdomly generate a password that meets certain criteria creating a strong password that provides greater security.

When in need of a new security password you can click on the button and one is generated for you. There are a series of prompts that allows you to outline your password criteria. Simple press OK or CANCEL to accept or deny the criteria respectively. The criteria allows you to determine the length between 8 to 128 chararcters in length, choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. After all prompts are have cycled through and been answered then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria selected. When the password is generated it will be written on the page where it can be copied and pasted to desired location.
